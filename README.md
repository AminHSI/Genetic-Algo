-this repository imported originally from @ss-Akuma contains a simple example of implementing the genetic algorithm and how it works is to calculate a combination of digits which you set upon running the program. please consider to input every digit separately(by an empty space or seperate inputs), since the combinations were implemented using arrays.also feel free to customize the configuration values, get a hang of the key-ingredients of the genetic-algorithm and check out the pdf file if you need some introductions to this algo.
