-this repository imported originally from @ss-Akuma contains a simple example of implementing the genetic algorithm and how it works is to calculate a combination of digits which you set upon running the program.
-please consider to input every digit separately(by an empty space or seperate inputs), since the combinations were implemented using arrays.
